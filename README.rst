Features
========
 - very lightweight (84KB of private memory per instance)
 - fixes broken CR/LF in headers
 - handles environment in a sane way (CGI scripts get HTTP-related env. vars from FastCGI parameters and inherit all the others from ``fcgiwrap``'s environment)
 - no configuration, so you can run several sites off the same ``fcgiwrap`` pool
 - passes CGI stderr output to ``fcgiwrap``'s stderr (this is by design but stderr could be also passed to FastCGI stderr stream)

Installation
============

requirements
------------
``Makefile`` and ``configure`` script is generated by GNU *autotools*. Therefore you need the latter.

``fcgiwrap`` links to *dev-libs/fcgi* which can be obtained from http://www.fastcgi.com/ .

procedure
---------
To install::

    autoconf
    ./configure
    make
    make install

*fcgiwrap* will be copied to ``/usr/local/sbin/fcgiwrap`` if you did not set
``--prefix`` for configure or ``DESTDIR`` for the makefile.

usage
-----
Most probably you will want ``fcgiwrap`` be launched by `www-servers/spawn-fcgi <http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/spawn-fcgi>`_. Or you could use the author's Perl launcher - see the homepage for that.

When running, ``fcgiwrap`` evaluates environment variables *DOCUMENT_ROOT* and *SCRIPT_NAME*, concatenates them and invokes the resulting executable (should it exist).
